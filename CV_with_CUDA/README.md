# computer vision with CUDA

## 1. Intro
This project aims to compare CV algorithms and identify the fastest one,
and develop CUDA kernels faster than OpenCV with CUDA and TBB.

## 2. Environments
- OS: Windows 11
- CPU: intel i9-13900K
- GPU: RTX A5000

To run this project, you must install CUDA and build OpenCV with CUDA.
Additionally, yout CPU should be an Intel processor or support OneAPI for TBB.
